We'll now go over the basic day-to-day source control operations you need to be familiar with.

###Your first commit

As we touched upon briefly in Part 1, committing with Git is different conceptually than in centralized version control systems like TFS and SVN. Git is a distributed version control system, and a full clone of the "central" repository from github.com (or hosted elsewhere) is kept locally on your machine.

Thus, when you commit some changes, you do so locally on your own computer - which allows you to work offline. There's also a brand new concept that comes before committing: the staging area.

Let's illustrate with our example. We are currently on the newly-created *develop* branch and we make a change to the README file. Note that the file status tab in SourceTree is automatically refreshed to indicate that your working copy is not clean anymore:

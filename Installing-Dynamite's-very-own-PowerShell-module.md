## Get the latest GSoft.Dynamite.SP package, install DSP

Refer to [Installing the Dynamite NuGet packages from our MyGet.org feeds](https://github.com/GSoft-SharePoint/Dynamite/wiki/Installing-the-Dynamite-NuGet-packages-from-our-MyGet.org-feeds#solution-wide-package-gsoftdynamitesp) for instructions on how to get the latest version of the Dynamite PowerShell Toolkit (aka DSP) and how to install it.

## Explore the possibilities

While the DSP PowerShell modules are now maintained within the Dynamite and Dynamite-2010 repos themselve, there is still some relevant documentation in the old (now deprecated) DSP repository here:https://github.com/GSoft-SharePoint/Dynamite-PowerShell-Toolkit/wiki.

## Be ambitious, automate everything

Refer to [this article](https://github.com/GSoft-SharePoint/Dynamite/wiki/On-the-evils-of-Visual-Studio-based-deployments#automate-your-test-and-production-site-initialization-process) to know what your basic automation objectives should be. Everything you automate will end up being a time saver, in the long run.

This guide aims to give you step-by-step instructions on how to use SourceTree to manage your source control. For demo purposes, we'll begin by creating a new empty project on github.com

### Create a new project on github and clone it
From [GSoft-SharePoint's organization page](https://github.com/organizations/GSoft-SharePoint), click on *New repository*.

Make sure to check the option to create a README file. Also, Github gives you the handy option of adding a pre-configured .gitignore file: choose the CSharp settings. The typical open source license we use is MIT License.

The recommended git client app to contribute on Team Dynamite's project is Atlassian's SourceTree because of its dummy-proof integration of git-flow.

### Create a github.com account
If you don't have one already, create a github.com account. If you work for [GSoft](http://www.gsoft.com), create [an issue](https://github.com/GSoft-SharePoint/Dynamite/issues) to ask one of the Team Dynamite owners to add you to a contributor's team for the project you want to work on.

If you are a third-party developer looking to contribute to Team Dynamite's projects, please fork the project in your own profile, make your improvements then [submit a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) to ask Team Dynamite to merge in your changes.

### Download and install SourceTree
